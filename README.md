# Simulation-of-SIR-model
Problem 1 of Project 1 in TMA4265 - Stochastic Modeling
This is a simple program for simulation of SIR model with discrete markov chain

main.py - execution of the simulation and write data to file

tasks.py - execution of subtasks in the problem

SIR.py - tools for simulation of the model
